## 🎮 Features

- **3D Graphics**: Beautiful 3D basketball court with realistic hoop, backboard, and net
- **Physics Engine**: Realistic ball physics with gravity and trajectory calculations
- **Power Charging System**: Click and hold to charge your shot power
- **Score Tracking**: Real-time score and shot statistics
- **Accuracy Stats**: Track your shooting percentage
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid ball rotation and flight path
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Touch Support**: Play with mouse or touch controls

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Charge Your Shot**: Click and hold the mouse (or touch and hold on mobile)
2. **Watch the Power Bar**: The bar fills up - green (low), yellow (medium), red (high power)
3. **Release to Shoot**: Let go to launch the basketball
4. **Score Points**: Get the ball through the hoop to score!
5. **Track Your Stats**: Monitor your score, total shots, and accuracy percentage
